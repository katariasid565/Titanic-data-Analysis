# Titanic Survival Analysis Report

## Introduction
The Titanic dataset provides information about passengers on the Titanic, including demographic details, passenger class, and survival status. The objective of this analysis is to explore the factors that may have influenced survival during the Titanic disaster.

The dataset contains the following key columns:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger
- **Survived**: Whether the passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1 = First Class, 2 = Second Class, 3 = Third Class)
- **Name**: Passenger's name
- **Sex**: Passenger's gender
- **Age**: Passenger's age
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Ticket price
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Data Cleaning
To ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis, we perform the following steps:
- Fill missing values in the "Age" column with the median age.
- Remove rows with missing "Embarked" values.
- Standardize the "Sex" column by converting it to lowercase.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the Titanic dataset
titanic_data = pd.read_csv('train.csv')

# Fill missing "Age" with median
titanic_data['Age'].fillna(titanic_data['Age'].median(), inplace=True)

# Drop rows with missing "Embarked" values
titanic_data.dropna(subset=['Embarked'], inplace=True)

# Standardize the "Sex" column
titanic_data['Sex'] = titanic_data['Sex'].str.lower()

Absolutely! When writing an analysis report for a Jupyter Notebook, you should ensure it's structured clearly, with text explanations and code snippets presented in a way that's easy to understand. I'll create an example analysis report and insight for a data analysis project using the Titanic dataset as a basis. You can copy and paste this into your Jupyter Notebook to use as a template for your analysis.

- **Fare**: Ticket price
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Data Cleaning
To ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis, we perform the following steps:
- Fill missing values in the "Age" column with the median age.
- Remove rows with missing "Embarked" values.
- Standardize the "Sex" column by converting it to lowercase.

titanic_data.dropna(subset=['Embarked'], inplace=True)

# Standardize the "Sex" column
titanic_data['Sex'] = titanic_data['Sex'].str.lower()
```

## Data Analysis and Insights
Here are some key insights from our analysis:

### Survival Rates by Gender
We examined survival rates based on gender. It appears that gender had a significant impact on survival, with a much higher survival rate among females.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Survival rates by gender
sns.countplot(data=titanic_data, x='Sex', hue='Survived')
plt.title('Survival Rates by Gender')
plt.show()

# Calculate survival rates
survival_rates_gender = titanic_data.groupby('Sex')['Survived'].mean()
print("Survival rates by gender:")
print(survival_rates_gender)
```

- **Observation**: Females had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.
- **Insight**: This suggests that gender played a role in survival, likely due to the "women and children first" policy during the evacuation.

### Survival Rates by Passenger Class
Next, we analyzed the impact of passenger class on survival. It seems that the survival rates were higher for first-class passengers.

```python
# Survival rates by passenger class
sns.countplot(data=titanic_data, x='Pclass', hue='Survived')
plt.title('Survival Rates by Passenger Class')
plt.show()

# Calculate survival rates by class
survival_rates_class = titanic_data.groupby('Pclass')['Survived'].mean()
print("Survival rates by passenger class:")
print(survival_rates_class)
```

- **Observation**: First-class passengers had a higher survival rate than those in third class.
- **Insight**: This could be due to their proximity to lifeboats and easier access to escape routes.

### Age Distribution and Survival
We explored the relationship between age and survival. The distribution shows that younger passengers had higher survival rates.

```python
# Age distribution and survival
sns.boxplot(data=titanic_data, x='Survived', y='Age')
plt.title('Age vs. Survival')
plt.show()

# Calculate survival rates by age group
titanic_data['AgeGroup'] = pd.cut(titanic_data['Age'], bins=[0, 18, 40, 60, 80], labels=['Child', 'Adult', 'Middle-aged', 'Senior'])
survival_rates_age_group = titanic_data.groupby('AgeGroup')['Survived'].mean()
print("Survival rates by age group:")
print(survival_rates_age_group)
```

- **Observation**: Children and younger adults had a higher survival rate compared to middle-aged and senior passengers.
- **Insight**: This reinforces the idea of "women and children first," as well as the possibility that older passengers had more difficulty escaping during the disaster.

## Conclusion
Based on this analysis, we found that gender, passenger class, and age were key factors influencing survival on the Titanic. Females, first-class passengers, and younger individuals had higher survival rates. These insights can help understand the events and decisions during the Titanic disaster.

## Future Work
In future analyses, we could consider exploring additional factors, such as fare price, ticket type, or social connections (siblings/spouses/parents/children aboard), to determine if these factors also influenced survival.
